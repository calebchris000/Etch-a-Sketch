#Etch A Sketch Project

Etch a Sketch is a classic drawing toy that has been around since the 1960s. It consists of a gray screen enclosed in a red plastic frame, with two white knobs on the front for drawing. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can create a digital version of an Etch a Sketch. To do this, you will need to use HTML to create the layout and structure of the page, CSS to style the page and add visual effects, and JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the Etch a Sketch. Using these technologies, you can create a virtual Etch a Sketch that allows users to draw and erase lines on the screen just like the classic toy.
